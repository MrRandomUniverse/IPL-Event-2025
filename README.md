## 📅 When It Happens

- **1 hour before each IPL match**, the betting panel opens in `#events`.
- It stays open until **15 minutes before** the match begins.
- You'll have that window to place your bets!

---

## 🎮 How Betting Works

- Bet using your **Discord XP**, based on your level.
- Choose the team you think will **win** the match.
- If your team **wins** ➜ you earn XP.
- If your team **loses** ➜ XP is deducted — BUT...

### 🎲 Random Refunds

Even if you lose, **Mr. Random’s magic** might bless you with a partial XP refund.  
The % refund is based on **pure randomness** AND your **server activity**.

> 👥 **The more active you are in the server, the higher your refund chance.**  
> Stay engaged, chat around, and let Mr. Random reward you for it!

| Scenario         | What Happens                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Your team wins   | You earn bonus XP (rewarded based on bet)     |
| Your team loses  | You lose XP, but get a random partial refund! |
| No show / no bet | Nothing happens                                |

## 🧠 Betting Tips

- Bet smart — not just emotionally.
- Keep an eye on team forms and matchups.
- Don't risk it all in one go (unless you love chaos).
- Be active to boost your refund chances!
---

## 🧠 Fair Play & Automation

### 🧾 Weekly XP Taxes

To keep things fair for **non-bettors** and prevent farming:
- **Top betting winners** will be taxed **every weekend**.
- A small % of their gained XP will be collected as a **“balance tax.”**

> ⚖️ Keeps the playing field level and fun for everyone!

---

### 💸 XP Betting Limits

- To maintain fairness and prevent leaderboard exploitation, Betable XP is capped at **50,000**.
- This ensures no user can gain an unfair advantage through excessive betting.

> 🚫 Prevents leaderboard abuse through excessive XP betting.

---

### 🤖 Meet the Bet Professor

We call it **The Bet Professor** (originally Bet Processor) — our very own AI that handles the boring stuff:

- Automatically logs and processes **who bet what on which team**
- Calculates winners and adjusts XP
- Cleans up all bets and resets the panel for the **next event**

> ✅ No manual work. No delays. All handled by AI. Clean and smooth betting!

## 🧪 Behind the Scenes – The Magic of the Backend

This entire IPL system runs like a well-oiled XP machine — thanks to our talented developers:  
**👨‍💻 Godz** and **👨‍💻 RKN**, the brains behind the operation.

Here’s exactly how everything works behind the scenes:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Bet Placement Logged

- Once a user clicks the button and places a bet successfully, the **raw betting data** is instantly logged in our **backend channels**.
- This includes:
  - Who bet
  - How much XP
  - Which team they chose

![Bet Logged](images/betlogged.png)
---

### 🔄 Step 2: Bot Processing

- Bots take this raw data and **convert it into a readable and displayable format**.
- This is mainly for internal clarity — makes it easier to double-check everything.
  
![Bot Processing](images/betprocessing.png)
---

### 📢 Step 3: Public Bet Display

- The processed bet information is **posted publicly** in the `#server-notifs` channel.
- Everyone can see who bet on what and for how much — 100% transparency.

---

### 🏁 Step 4: Match Ends — Bet Resolution

- After the match ends and we have a result, the **Bet Professor** steps in.
- It processes all bets, checks which team won, and **removes or rewards XP** accordingly.
  
![Win/Loss](images/win&loose.png)
---

### 📢 Step 5: Final XP Outcome Display

- The final XP results (who gained, who lost, and how much) are then **automatically sent to the public `#server-notifs`** channel.
- This is where users get to see how they performed after the match.

> 💡 Every step is automated, traceable, and built with transparency in mind — all thanks to our team’s magic.
